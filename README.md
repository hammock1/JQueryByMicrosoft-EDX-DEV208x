Module 1 

For module one, you will create the initial interface for your review widget. The interface must meet the following goals:

Provide five circles for the user to select or click on. When the user hovers their mouse over a circle, that circle and all circles to the left must be filled with a color, such as yellow. You can see a screenshot of this below. Screenshot showing the desired hover state. There is introductory text on the top, and then 5 circles below. The mouse is over the third circle. The third circle, as well as the two to the left, are displayed with a yellow highlight. The two circles to the right of the mouse are not highlighted.

When the user clicks on a circle, that circle and all circles to the left must be filled with a different color, such as green. The color must remain, even after the user moves their mouse away from the widget. You do not need to remember the number for page refreshes. You can see a sample of this below. Image showing the clicked state of the desired lab result. The mouse is below the third circle, which is the one that has been clicked on. The third circle, as well as the two to the left of it, are highlighted as green. The two circles to the right are not highlighted. The mouse has been moved away from the circles, but the green highlight remains.

HTML and CSS for the interface has been provided for your use. The lab can be solved without using any additional HTML; you only need to provide the necessary jQuery.

First, break the requirements down into steps, and then implement each step. For example, for the hover requirements:

The user hovers over a circle. That circle, and all the ones to its left, must be highlighted. 
To implement this, we must first discover what circle the user has moved their mouse over. 
Then, we need to select that circle, and the ones to the left of it in the collection of circles. We must highlight those circles.
This can be done by adding a class to those circles. The class provided is highlight. 
We must ensure the circles to the right aren't highlighted. You could do this by removing the highlight class
